## Requirements
1. **Start a new match**, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard. This should capture following parameters:
   - Home team
   - Away team
1. **Update score**. This should receive a pair of absolute scores:
   - home team score
   - away team score
1. **Finish match** currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
